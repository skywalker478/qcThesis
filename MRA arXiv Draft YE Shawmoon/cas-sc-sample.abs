The emergence of quantum computing possesses a significant security threat to the current classical system, since it has the potential to outperform the current classical computer in some specific task due to their unique principle of operation. This necessitates finding a method that is resistive to quantum computers to securely transfer information. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a novel method combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91 protocol with the classical encryption-authentication protocol, i.e. ChaCha20-Poly1305 and concealing information within another message through steganography to securely transfer audio messages. A shared secret key is created between the communicating parties using E91 QKD, which exploits the stellar protection of quantum entanglement against eavesdropping. The shared key is hashed through the SHA-3 hash function to generate a fixed-length, high-entropy symmetric key. The audio message is hidden inside another audio signal through steganography. The steganographic signal is encrypted using ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD in order to provide another layer of obfuscation as well as a means to verify integrity. Through rigorous experiment, we validated the robustness of the proposed methodology in both classical and quantum attacks. The processing of secret audio signals of varying duration (00:01:32 to 00:01:36) exhibits consistent encryption results. The encrypted stego audios show high randomness, with an average entropy of $15.99842$, an average correlation of $0
        .0000146272$, an average UACI of $49.99767132$, and an average NSCR of $99.998489697\%$.  We demonstrated the safety of the shared key using the CHSH inequality test, where in the presence of an eavesdropper the CHSH value is very less than $2\sqrt{2}$. In addition, the integrity of the secret audios is also validated through the verification of the authentication tag generated during the encryption process. Our research offers a novel framework for secure audio transmission, combining classical encryption and authentication methods with QKD to enhance confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against eavesdropping, ensuring robust end-to-end security.
